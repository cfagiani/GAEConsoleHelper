GAEConsoleHelper
================

Simple Chrome extension that allows you to jump to the Google App Engine admin console for the app engine site you're visiting.
This is helpful if you administer multiple appengine-based applications.

The extension will display the App Engine logo in the address bar whenever you are visiting a site hosted on the appspot.com domain.
Clicking the icon will open a new tab and navigate to the site's appengine console. Obviously, this is only useful when you have access to the admin console for the application.

If you already have the admin console open in another tab when you click the icon, it will simply bring that tab to the foreground.
